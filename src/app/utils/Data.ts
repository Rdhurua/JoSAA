    question: "Who can benefit from our counselling service?",
    answer: "Anyone who is confused about which is the best institute or branch they can get with their JEE rank, or unsure about how to fill choices and navigate the counselling process, can benefit from our service. Whether you're aiming for the top colleges, a specific branch, or simply want to make the most informed decisions, our guidance is designed to support you every step of the way.",
  },
    {
    question: "Will you fill in the choices for me or just guide me on how to do it?",
    answer: "We offer both options based on your preference. If you choose to have us fill in the choices for you, we will prepare and arrange them in the best possible order and then contact you over a phone call to confirm and ask you to lock the choices and proceed. Alternatively, if you prefer to fill them yourself, we will provide you with a detailed choice preference list through WhatsApp, and you can lock and proceed as per our guidance. The choice is completely yours!",
  },
  {
    question: "How will I receive the counselling support and guidance?",
    answer: "Once you pay the counselling fee and complete registration, we begin by helping you with the choice filling based on your preferences. You can either let us fill the choices for you or receive a personalized preference list to fill yourself. After that, we keep you updated with timely alerts and reminders about important deadlines, choice locking, and next steps through email and WhatsApp, ensuring you don’t miss anything throughout the JoSAA or CSAB counselling process.",
  },

  {
    question: "Can you help if I have a low rank but want the best possible college?",
    answer: "Absolutely! This is the core purpose of our counselling service. Our main motto is to help every student, regardless of their rank, secure the best and most desirable admission possible based on their score. With smart choice filling, proper strategy, and expert guidance, we aim to get you the maximum value out of your rank, whether it's targeting a better branch, college, or both.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you help in both JoSAA and CSAB counselling?",
    answer: "Yes, we guide students through both JoSAA and CSAB counselling. Initially, we focus on JoSAA counselling and help you aim for the best possible admission. If you get your desired college or branch through JoSAA, our work ends there. However, if you don't get a satisfactory allotment, we assess your chances and advise whether it's worth proceeding with CSAB counselling. If you choose to go ahead after our guidance, we continue to support you through CSAB as well — without any extra charges.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you have a referral policy or any discount for referring friends?",
    answer: "Yes, we have a referral policy to reward both the referrer and the referred student. If you refer a friend, you will receive ₹30 for each successful referral. Meanwhile, the student you refer will get a ₹20 discount on the counselling fee by applying your referral code during registration. It's a simple way to benefit together while helping more students make smart choices during JoSAA counselling.",
